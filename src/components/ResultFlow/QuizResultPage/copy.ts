    "Being your authentic self means embracing who you truly are‚Äîyour strengths, quirks, and values. Confidence comes from accepting yourself and not feeling pressured to fit others‚Äô expectations. When you act genuinely, you build trust and create opportunities for meaningful connections that are more likely to last.",
  [Symptom.SelfControlChallenge]:
    "Clear communication helps others understand your thoughts, feelings, and needs without confusion. It involves both speaking honestly and listening actively. To improve, be mindful of your tone, choose words carefully, and check that your message is understood. Strong communication reduces misunderstandings and strengthens relationships.",
  [Symptom.InternalSignalDysfunction]:
    "Setting goals gives your dating journey direction and purpose, while having a strategy turns those goals into actionable steps. Breaking larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks helps you stay motivated and track progress. A clear plan also lets you adjust when obstacles arise, keeping you on track to find the connections you want.",
